* Make sure all IRC client events are handled (most are handled at the moment)
* Implement support for multiple channels
* Implement private message support
* Implement support for listing users in a channel
* Make it so that when you restart the server, the client can handle it properly
* Should probably figure out a way to get MOTD formatted properly
